# OSA-SE-Customizer-Names

## Customizer
Customizer comes with OSA and handles randomization for default NPCs that have no persona/profile data. 
These should be packed when finished into OSA-SE but i pulled them out on git so they are easier / clearer to work on. 

# Names

Names handles the randomization of NPC names for anything that has a generic type name like GUARD, BANDIT etc. based on race and sex it then formulates a name.

# Style of the names

The names that can be achieved in this xml should be lore-friendly and serious as if part of Skyrim itself. Forks can be used for crazier variations.

# CustomRaces

Extremely popular custom races / npc types can be added but for most let them be handled in forks.
